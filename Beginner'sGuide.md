**Welcome to our game Beginners!**
Some people might think that they have wasted 30 coins for nothing. But, here are our tips... and tricks
from the makers themselves!
**VERY HELPFUL TIP**
Split the money. Don't spend it all on Ammo and Guns;
Remember, there are different characters.

    **Very Helpful Note for Guns/Lvls:**
    *#Infinite Levels 1~20*
    If I were you, since there are 20 coins in the first round, save up in the second round and the third round in a total of (20+30+80) 130 coins. With 130 coins, you can buy the MG 42, which will probably with enough luck, help you go through the first three levels, and since **The SHOP cannot be ACCESSED until LVL 3**, this will be enough to buy the MG 42. This gun will help you last the first 1~20 infinite levls (ILV). 
    *Infinite Levels 21~40*
    A simple piece of advice for these levels: *SAVE UP FOR THE SMG* because the Lazer's Ammo costs money and very likely, there is no way that you can get enough coins for the Lazer. 
    *Infinite Levels 41~80*
    Another simple piece of advice: Buy the Lazer and a lot, I mean a lot, of ammo. 
    *Infinite Levels 81+* 
    A few pieces of advice? Buy the last gun, the Ailenator and buy a lot of ammos for the gun. Plus, save enough coins for the heal items. Buy now, you should have at least a decent character/armour.
